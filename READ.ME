When you cd to mydir, scripts will run in the following order:
  1) cdhooks/incoming/pre-local/
  2) mydir/.cdhooks/incoming/
  3) cdhooks/incoming/post-local/

When you cd away from mydir:
  1) cdhooks/outgoing/pre-local/
  2) mydir/.cdhooks/outgoing/
  3) cdhooks/outgoing/post-local/

All of the outgoing scripts run before any of the incoming scripts.
